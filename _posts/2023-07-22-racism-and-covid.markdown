The Covid pandemic has not only been a global health crisis but has also served as a catalyst for a disturbing rise in racism, particularly against Asian communities. This surge in prejudice and discrimination has been observed and felt deeply, shedding light on the broader issue of racism that pervades society and the art world.

During these challenging times, the artist Naomi Makkelie has noted an unsettling increase in racism towards Asian people, a reflection of deep-seated biases that have been magnified by the pandemic. This observation is crucial, as it underscores the multifaceted nature of racism, which can manifest against any race or ethnicity, not just those that are often the focus of mainstream discussions.

The art world, much like society at large, has been grappling with issues of discrimination and racism. While there has been significant attention on the struggles faced by black people, women, and the LGBTQ community, the experiences of Asian individuals during the pandemic highlight the need for a more inclusive approach to understanding and addressing racism. The artist's statement brings to light the importance of recognizing that racism is not limited to certain groups but is a pervasive issue that can affect all races and genders.

Art has the power to challenge societal norms, provoke thought, and inspire change. By bringing attention to the increased racism faced by Asian communities during the Covid pandemic, artists like Naomi Makkelie play a vital role in fostering a more inclusive and understanding society. Through their work, they invite us to reflect on our biases, question the status quo, and strive for a world where respect and empathy transcend racial and ethnic boundaries.

In conclusion, the Covid pandemic has exposed and intensified the racism that exists within our society and the art world. It is a stark reminder of the work that remains to be done in combating prejudice and promoting inclusivity. As we move forward, let us look to art not only as a source of beauty and inspiration but also as a powerful tool for social change, challenging us to envision and create a more equitable world for all.

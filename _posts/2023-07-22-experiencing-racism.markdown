The Covid-19 pandemic, while primarily a global health crisis, has also served as a catalyst for revealing and intensifying underlying societal issues, notably racism. As an artist with an Asian background, the pandemic period has been particularly revealing of the latent prejudices that pervade both society and the art world.

During the height of the pandemic, I encountered numerous instances of racism, from subtle microaggressions to overt discrimination. These experiences were not isolated incidents but part of a larger pattern of xenophobia that seemed to surge as the virus spread. The blame placed on Asian communities for the pandemic has reignited age-old stereotypes and prejudices, casting a shadow over the collective struggle against the virus.

The broader issue of racism in society has been magnified during this period. While the pandemic has affected everyone, it has disproportionately impacted marginalized communities, highlighting existing inequalities. The rise in racism is not just a reflection of individual prejudices but a systemic issue that requires a collective response.

In the art world, discussions around racism often focus on specific narratives, sometimes overlooking the multifaceted nature of racism. My experiences during the pandemic have underscored the need for a more inclusive understanding of racismâ€”one that acknowledges its impact on all races and genders. The art community, with its platform for expression and influence, has a crucial role to play in fostering this broader dialogue.

As we move forward, it is imperative that we embrace a more inclusive perspective on racism, recognizing the diverse experiences and challenges faced by individuals across the spectrum of race and gender. Art, in its unique capacity to reflect and challenge societal norms, can be a powerful tool in this endeavor.

In conclusion, the Covid-19 pandemic has not only been a health crisis but also a mirror reflecting the deep-seated issues within our society. As an artist, I believe in the power of art to challenge, heal, and inspire change. Through our collective efforts, I hope we can build a more inclusive and empathetic world, where diversity is celebrated, and racism in all its forms is unequivocally condemned.
